    "## Question 2.Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?\n",
    "Both `np.mean()` and `np.average()` are functions in NumPy used to calculate the average of values in an array, but they have some differences in functionality. Here’s a simple comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `np.mean()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculates the arithmetic mean of an array.\n",
    "- **How it Works**: It sums all the elements in the array and divides by the number of elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - Operations on arrays with specific data types can be faster than on mixed or incompatible types. NumPy is optimized for operations on homogeneous data (all elements of the same type), which leads to better performance and faster computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity**:\n",

    "## Question 5.Define ndarrays in NumPy and explain their key features. How do they differ from standard Python lists?\n",
    "### Definition of ndarrays\n",
    "In NumPy, **ndarrays** (n-dimensional arrays) are special data structures used to store collections of numbers in a grid-like format. They can have one or more dimensions, making them versatile for various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of ndarrays\n",
    "1. **Same Type**: All elements in an ndarray are of the same data type, which helps in efficient storage and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Dimensions**: Ndarrays can be one-dimensional (like a list), two-dimensional (like a table), or even more dimensions, allowing for complex data arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed**: Ndarrays are faster than standard Python lists for mathematical operations because they are optimized for performance and use less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Easy Calculations**: You can perform calculations on all elements at once (like adding a number to every element) without needing loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Broadcasting**: This feature lets you perform operations on arrays of different shapes without extra coding, making it easier to work with datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Built-in Functions**: NumPy offers many functions specifically for ndarrays, such as those for statistical analysis or linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Standard Python Lists\n",
    "1. **Type Consistency**: Python lists can hold different types of elements (like integers and strings), while ndarrays require all elements to be the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**: Ndarrays are more efficient for numerical tasks, while Python lists can be slower and use more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **True Dimensions**: Ndarrays support multi-dimensional data natively, while Python lists need to be nested (lists within lists) to achieve similar structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functionality**: Ndarrays come with many built-in math functions, while Python lists require more manual effort for similar calculations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 6.Analyze the performance benefits of NumPy arrays over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations.\n",
    "NumPy arrays offer several performance benefits over Python lists, especially for large-scale numerical operations. Here’s a breakdown in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Speed**\n",
    "- **Optimized for Math**: NumPy is designed specifically for numerical calculations. Its operations are implemented in lower-level languages (like C), making them much faster than operations on Python lists.\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations**: With NumPy, you can perform calculations on entire arrays at once (like adding or multiplying all elements). This is much quicker than using loops to do the same with Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
    "- **Compact Storage**: NumPy arrays use less memory than Python lists because they store data in a more compact way. Since all elements are of the same type, NumPy can optimize how they are stored.\n",
    "- **Contiguous Memory**: Ndarrays are stored in a single block of memory, which reduces overhead and allows faster access to data compared to Python lists, which can have scattered memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Less Overhead**\n",
    "- **Fixed Size**: Once you create a NumPy array, its size is fixed. This reduces overhead compared to Python lists, which can grow and shrink dynamically, requiring more memory management.\n",
    "- **Homogeneous Types**: Since all elements in a NumPy array are of the same type, NumPy avoids the type-checking overhead that Python lists incur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Built-in Functions**\n",
    "- **Rich Library of Functions**: NumPy provides a wide range of optimized mathematical functions that can be applied directly to arrays, reducing the need to write custom functions and speeding up development and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In summary, NumPy arrays are faster, more memory-efficient, and optimized for numerical operations compared to Python lists. This makes them the preferred choice for large-scale data analysis and scientific computing."

    "## Question 10.Explain the concepts of vectorization and broadcasting in NumPy. How do they contribute to efficient array operations?\n",
    " ### Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "Vectorization refers to the ability to perform operations on entire arrays at once, rather than using loops to process each element individually. In NumPy, this means you can apply mathematical operations to all elements of an array simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Speed**: Vectorized operations are executed in compiled code, which makes them much faster than loops in Python.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Code becomes cleaner and easier to read since you can apply operations directly to arrays without writing complex loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Instead of adding 1 to each element of an array with a loop, you can do it like this:"

    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "Broadcasting is a feature that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes without requiring explicit reshaping. When you operate on two arrays of different sizes, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the size of the larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
